First sketch of project homescreen, and quizz interface 8/12/2019
			
as you can see, the theme of the homescreen and quizz interface was completely different, but this was solved further along in the app development process
At this point, the homescreen had animations running in the background and the mechanics of the Quizzes in the Boss levels work well. 
First attempt at the “Normal Level”, main mechanics of the game 8/12/2019

As it can be seen, the mechanics have not yet been added, the rocket/cannon/ shooter has not yet been implemented, the bullet action is also missing, but as the first sketch, a lot of progress was made today.










Meeting No.3 (9/12/2019)
We touched base on who has done what, separated the tasks regarding the documents, and made further progress on the design of the app in order to improve overall user experience.



Refreshed look of the project home screen and Quiz screen
 

The design of the app is improved immensely, there is now a theme of adventure and progress attached.
As for the shooter, we have decided to go with a rocket to increase the sense of progress as it soars into the open sky. 
Double tapping the rocket would now generate a bullet heading up









The only change here is the changing of the background to fit it to the theme of adventure.











Meeting No.4 (10/12/19)
Met to sort out documentation responsibilities
Further improved UI design,
Worked on the General Game Mechanics

The design for the quiz app is further improved 

Health bar introduced, when the player answers the Boss correctly, the bosses’ health bar decreases, when the player answers the Boss wrongly, the player’s health decreases.
We also gave Professor densmore a helmet.
